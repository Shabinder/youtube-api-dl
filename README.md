# youtube-api-dl
Multiplatform Youtube parser for retrieving youtube video metadata.

Library is not stable, because Youtube often changes web structure of its pages. I don't use this library regularly to find the errors. Thats why errors are fixed as soon as someone finds it and opens an issue. Feel free to report an error or sumbit a PR.

This Library started as a Kotlin port of [java-youtube-downloader](https://github.com/sealedtx/java-youtube-downloader) (thanks @sealedtx for such awesome library and inspiration) and now aims to support multiple targets like jvm, js, ios.

This is still a work in progress and Contributions are welcome!
